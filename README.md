# Weather Scraper
This is a webscraping tool to get information about the weather.

The tool is currently set to get weather information for San Francisco.

However, this can be set to a different location by choosing an alternative town/city using this [Weather Forecast](https://www.weather.gov/) website, and altering the *URL* in the script.
